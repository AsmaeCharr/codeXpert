            "We use Arithmetic Operators to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplicationâ€¦ Now you will learn the ones that are used the most!\n Addition, Subtraction, Increment and Decrement\n  - The addition operator is (+). For example: x + y;\n  - The subtraction operator is (-). For example: x - y;
To increment a number by one we use the operator (++). For example: x++ is the same as x = x + 1;
To decrement a number by one be user the operator (--). For example: x--  is the same as x = x - 1;",
