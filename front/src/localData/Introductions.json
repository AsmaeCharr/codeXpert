Conditional statements are used to decide how the code will act depending on if the given condition is true or false. For example, if a condition is true we redirect the user to the landing page, else, we redirect to the login page. In Javascript it would look like this:</p> <p>if (condition) {</p><p>redirect to the landing page</p><p>} else {</p><p>redirect to the login page</p><p>}</p>",
            "<p>Where condition could be for example, if a given number is equal to 0, it would look like this: if (givenNumber == 0).</p><p>To compare numbers we use the operator == or !=, the first operator will return true if the two numbers we are comparing are the same, for example: 3 == 3. The second operator will return true if the numbers are different, for example: 3 != 4. We can also compare if a number is bigger/lower than another number. For example 3 < 4 equals true. If we add an equal to it the number can be bigger/lower than or equal, for example: 3 >= 3 equals true.</p>"
